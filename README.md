# 🎬 Semantic Recommendation System for Science Fiction Movies  
**When Search Understands Meaning**

> “Show me movies about questioning reality and the nature of existence.”  
> → *The Matrix*, *Inception*, *Ex Machina*  
>  
> Not by keyword… but by meaning.  

This project demonstrates how to build a **semantic search and recommendation engine** that understands **themes, moods, and concepts** instead of just matching keywords.  

Using **Sentence Transformers**, **chunking strategies**, and **Qdrant**, the system embeds detailed movie descriptions into a vector space—allowing natural language queries that reflect *meaning*, not syntax.

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

Imagine asking a search engine for *“movies about time travel and family relationships”* and getting **Interstellar**—even if those exact words never appear in the description.  

That’s **semantic search** in action.

### 🌌 What You’ll Build
A fully functional **semantic search engine** that can:
- 🔍 Understand **meaning** — find conceptually similar movies  
- 🧠 Compare **chunking strategies** — fixed, sentence-based, and semantic  
- 🧩 Handle **token constraints** — process long descriptions safely  
- 🎛 Filter results by **metadata** — genre, year, rating, etc.  
- 🧮 Group results — avoid duplicates when multiple chunks match  

---

## 🧱 Architecture Overview

| Component | Purpose |
|------------|----------|
| **SentenceTransformer (`all-MiniLM-L6-v2`)** | Converts movie descriptions into dense vector embeddings |
| **Qdrant Vector Database** | Stores embeddings and supports semantic search |
| **Chunking Strategies** | Splits large descriptions into meaningful pieces |
| **Cosine Similarity** | Measures closeness between query and movie embeddings |

---

## 🧩 Step-by-Step Pipeline

### 1️⃣ Dataset
A collection of **13 science fiction movies**, each with detailed, literary descriptions (240–460 tokens).  
Examples: *The Matrix*, *Interstellar*, *Arrival*, *Ex Machina*, *Annihilation*, etc.

### 2️⃣ Chunking Strategies
Long descriptions exceed the embedding model’s token limit (256), so we use three strategies:

| Strategy | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Fixed** | Splits every 40 tokens, ignoring sentence structure |
| **Sentence-based** | Splits on sentence boundaries with slight overlap |
| **Semantic** | Finds breaks based on **embedding similarity** between text parts |

### 3️⃣ Embedding & Storage
Each chunk is embedded into a 384-dimensional vector using **Sentence Transformers** and stored in **Qdrant** under three named vectors:
- `fixed`
- `sentence`
- `semantic`

### 4️⃣ Search & Comparison
Compare how different chunking methods affect retrieval results.  
Example queries:
```python
search_and_compare("alien invasion")
search_and_compare("questioning reality and existence")
````

---

## 🧮 Sample Output

```
Query: 'alien invasion'

--- FIXED CHUNKING ---
1. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)
   Chunk: the film opens with a group of botanist aliens visiting earth...

--- SENTENCE CHUNKING ---
1. E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982)
   Chunk: The film opens with a group of botanist aliens visiting Earth...

--- SEMANTIC CHUNKING ---
1. Annihilation (2018)
   Chunk: Annihilation is not a traditional alien invasion story...
```

---

## 🧠 Advanced Features

### 🧮 Metadata Filtering

Combine semantic search with structured filters:

```python
results = client.query_points(
    collection_name='movie_search',
    query=encoder.encode("artificial intelligence").tolist(),
    using="semantic",
    query_filter=models.Filter(
        must=[models.FieldCondition(key="year", range=models.Range(gte=2000))]
    ),
    limit=3
)
```

### 🎬 Grouping by Movie

Avoid duplicates by grouping multiple chunks from the same movie:

```python
response = client.query_points_groups(
    collection_name='movie_search',
    query=encoder.encode("time travel and family relationships").tolist(),
    using="semantic",
    group_by="name",
    limit=3
)
```

## 🧩 Key Learnings

* **Chunking impacts quality** — semantic chunking captures thematic meaning best
* **Token limits are real** — efficient chunking ensures embeddings fit within model constraints
* **Grouping is essential** — results represent *movies*, not chunks
* **Hybrid filtering** — semantic + metadata filters create powerful, flexible searches

---

## 📈 Future Enhancements

* Integrate with **frontend UI** for interactive semantic movie search
* Add **multilingual embeddings** for cross-language retrieval
* Use **larger embedding models** (e.g., `all-mpnet-base-v2`) for deeper understanding
* Incorporate **user preferences** to build a full-fledged recommendation engine
